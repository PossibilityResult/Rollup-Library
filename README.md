# The Rollup Library
Have been reading a lot about rollups recently and figured it might be useful to start an open library for the best so people don't need to spend as much time looking for good ones.

## Validity Mechanism

Resources on various mechanisms that can be used to determine whether a rollup block was valid.

#### Zero Knowledge Rollups
[EthHub: ZK-Rollups](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/)

[Understanding PLONK (Vitalik Buterin, September 2019)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html)

#### Optimistic Rollups

## Modular Components

#### Data Availability

#### Consensus

[Tendermint: Consensus without Mining (Jae Kwon, 2014)]()

#### Settlement

#### Execution

TODO

### Modular Stacks

Resources on different rollup structures i.e., where settlement, execution and consensus happen and where data availability is guaranteed.

#### Smart Contract Rollups

TODO

#### Sovereign Rollups
[Rollups as Sovereign Chains (Mustafa Al-Bassam, Ertem Nusret Tas, Nima Vaziri, July 2022)](https://blog.celestia.org/sovereign-rollup-chains/)**

#### Settlement Rollups

#### Enshrined Rollups

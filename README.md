# The Rollup Library
Have been reading a lot about rollups and modular blockchains recently and figured it might be useful to start an open library for the best so people don't need to spend as much time looking for good ones.

## Validity Mechanism

*Resources on various mechanisms that can be used to determine whether a rollup block was valid.*
